# New Project Feature - Complete Guide

## 🎉 What's New

You can now create projects with file uploads! The "New Project" quick action is fully functional and allows users to:

- Create new projects with name and description
- Upload multiple images, videos, and audio files
- Preview files before uploading
- Remove unwanted files before submission
- Automatic file organization in Supabase Storage

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **NewProject Page** (`frontend/src/pages/NewProject.jsx`)
A beautiful, modern form with:
- Project name and description fields
- Separate sections for images, videos, and audio files
- Drag-and-drop file selection (click to browse)
- Live file previews with thumbnails
- File count indicators
- Remove file functionality
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive design

### 2. **File Upload Backend** (`frontend/src/store/useProjectStore.js`)
Added three new methods:
- `uploadProjectFiles()` - Uploads files to Supabase Storage
- `getProjectFiles()` - Retrieves project files from database
- `deleteProjectFile()` - Deletes files from storage

### 3. **Database Schema**
- `project_files` table - Stores file metadata
- Row Level Security policies for secure access
- Automatic timestamps and triggers

### 4. **Navigation**
- Dashboard "New Project" card now navigates to `/new-project`
- Back button to return to dashboard
- Automatic redirect after successful project creation

## 🚀 How to Use

## 📋 Setup Required

Before the feature works, you need to set up Supabase:

### Step 1: Create Database Tables

Run these SQL scripts in Supabase SQL Editor (in order):

1. `frontend/supabase/create_project_tables.sql` (if not done already)
2. `frontend/supabase/create_storage_bucket.sql`

### Step 2: Create Storage Bucket

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → **Storage**
2. Click **Create a new bucket**
3. Settings:
   - Name: `project-files`
   - Public: Yes
   - File size limit: 50MB
4. Click **Create**

### Step 3: Set Storage Policies

Create 4 policies for the `project-files` bucket:

1. **INSERT policy**: Allow authenticated users to upload
2. **SELECT policy**: Allow authenticated users to view
3. **DELETE policy**: Allow authenticated users to delete
4. **UPDATE policy**: Allow authenticated users to update

See `STORAGE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.

## 🎨 UI Features

### Form Design
- Clean, modern glass-morphism design
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Responsive grid layout
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- Clear visual feedback

### File Upload Sections
Each file type (images/videos/audios) has:
- Icon indicator (🖼️ 🎥 🎵)
- File count display
- Dashed border upload area
- Grid preview layout (2-4 columns)
- Hover effects on file cards

### User Feedback
- Error messages in red banner
- Loading state on submit button
- Disabled state during upload
- Success redirect to dashboard

## 📁 File Organization

Files are stored in Supabase Storage with this structure:

```
project-files/
  └── {project-uuid}/
      ├── images/
      │   ├── 1234567890-abc123.jpg
      │   └── 1234567890-def456.png
      ├── videos/
      │   └── 1234567890-ghi789.mp4
      └── audios/
          └── 1234567890-jkl012.mp3
```

Each filename includes:
- Timestamp for uniqueness
- Random string for security
- Original file extension

## 🔒 Security

- **Row Level Security**: Users can only access their own files
- **Authentication required**: Must be logged in to upload
- **File validation**: Client-side file type filtering
- **Organized storage**: Files grouped by project ID
- **Secure URLs**: Public URLs generated by Supabase

## 📊 Dashboard Integration

After creating a project:
- **Active Projects** count increases by 1
- Project appears in projects list (when you build that page)
- Files are linked to the project
- Stats update automatically

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **React** - UI framework
- **Framer Motion** - Animations
- **Zustand** - State management
- **Supabase Storage** - File storage
- **Supabase Database** - Metadata storage

### File Upload Flow
1. User selects files → Preview generated
2. User clicks "Create Project" → Project created in DB
3. Files uploaded to Storage → Public URLs generated
4. File metadata saved to `project_files` table
5. User redirected to dashboard → Stats updated

### Error Handling
- Network errors caught and displayed
- File upload failures logged (but don't fail entire operation)
- Form validation for required fields
- Loading states prevent double submission

## 🎯 Next Steps

Now that you have project creation, you might want to build:

1. **Projects List Page** - View all projects
2. **Project Details Page** - View project files and info
3. **Edit Project** - Update project details
4. **Delete Project** - Remove projects and files
5. **File Gallery** - Better file viewing experience
6. **File Download** - Download files from projects

## 📝 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run SQL scripts in Supabase
- [ ] Create storage bucket
- [ ] Set up storage policies
- [ ] Test project creation without files
- [ ] Test uploading images only
- [ ] Test uploading videos only
- [ ] Test uploading audio only
- [ ] Test uploading mixed file types
- [ ] Test removing files before upload
- [ ] Test error handling (invalid data)
- [ ] Verify files appear in Supabase Storage
- [ ] Verify dashboard stats update
- [ ] Test on mobile/tablet (responsive)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to create project"
- Check if `projects` table exists
- Verify you're logged in
- Check browser console for errors

### "File upload error"
- Verify storage bucket exists
- Check storage policies are set
- Ensure file size is under limit
- Check file type is allowed

### Files not appearing
- Check Supabase Storage → project-files
- Verify `project_files` table exists
- Look for errors in browser console

### Dashboard stats not updating
- Refresh the page
- Check if project was created successfully
- Verify `initializeData()` is called
