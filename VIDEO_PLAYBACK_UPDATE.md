# Video Playback Feature - Now Working! ✅

## What Was Fixed

The video preview now **actually plays** your selected images and videos! Here's what was implemented:

### 🎬 Video Playback Features

1. **Media Preloading**
   - Images are preloaded as Image elements
   - Videos are preloaded as video elements
   - Video durations are automatically detected
   - All media cached for smooth playback

2. **Canvas Rendering**
   - 1920x1080 HD canvas
   - Real-time frame rendering
   - Proper scaling and centering
   - Smooth transitions between clips

3. **Playback Controls**
   - ▶ **Play/Pause** - Start/stop playback
   - ⏮ **Previous** - Jump to previous clip
   - ⏭ **Next** - Jump to next clip
   - Timeline scrubber - Seek to any position

4. **Animation Loop**
   - 60 FPS rendering
   - Smooth time progression
   - Automatic clip transitions
   - Auto-stop at end

## How It Works

### 1. Media Loading
When you enter the editor:
```javascript
- Images → Loaded as Image objects
- Videos → Loaded as video elements
- Durations → Automatically calculated
- Timeline → Updated with correct timings
```

### 2. Playback
When you click play:
```javascript
- Animation loop starts (60 FPS)
- Current time increments
- Canvas renders current frame
- Clips play in sequence
```

### 3. Rendering
For each frame:
```javascript
- Find current clip based on time
- Get corresponding media element
- Draw to canvas (scaled & centered)
- For videos: sync video.currentTime
- For images: display for set duration
```

## 🎯 How to Test

1. **Go to Dashboard** → Click "New Project"
2. **Add Media**:
   - Select 2-3 images
   - Or select 1-2 videos
   - Or mix both!
3. **Click "Continue to Editor →"**
4. **In Video Editor**:
   - You'll see all clips in timeline
   - Canvas shows first frame
5. **Click Play ▶**:
   - Images display for 3 seconds each
   - Videos play at normal speed
   - Smooth transitions between clips
6. **Try Controls**:
   - Pause ⏸ - Stops playback
   - Previous ⏮ - Jump to previous clip
   - Next ⏭ - Jump to next clip
   - Scrubber - Drag to any position

## ✨ What Works Now

✅ **Images display** for set duration (default 3 seconds)
✅ **Videos play** with audio (muted in preview)
✅ **Smooth playback** at 60 FPS
✅ **Timeline scrubbing** - Seek anywhere
✅ **Clip navigation** - Previous/Next buttons

✅ **Centered display** - Professional look

## 🎨 Technical Details

### Canvas Rendering
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (Full HD)
- **Frame Rate**: 60 FPS
- **Scaling**: Fit to canvas (maintain aspect ratio)
- **Positioning**: Centered (letterbox/pillarbox)

### Time Management

- **Timeline**: Clips play sequentially
- **Scrubbing**: Instant seek to any position

### Performance

## 🔧 Customization

```javascript
// In animation loop
const deltaTime = (timestamp - lastTimeRef.current) / 1000 * playbackSpeed
```
